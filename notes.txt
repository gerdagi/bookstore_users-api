gin-gonic/gin api ını kullanıyoruz bütün http requestler
için, first layer and we use as a controller, we use MVC patern

go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin

input layer is going to be controller
and entry point of application is a controller
and the whole idea behind the controller is to provide
the functionality or the points to interact against
the users API 

main entry point is always controller

http framework is used just in app/application file 

json.Unmarshal, takes json input and converts to struct


we should have only one error structure 

in go, return parameters, if you have an error return parameter then that should be end of the parameter

This is a function
func validate(user *User){}

But this is a method
func (user *User) Validate(){}

services folder, entire bussiness logic is in services folder 

"dao" means data access object like a database
